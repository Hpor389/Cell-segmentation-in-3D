# Cell-segmentation-in-3D
Code used for cell segmentation from paper: Spatially controlling fibroblast to myofibroblast transition using Youngâ€™s modulus patterned gelatin methacryol hydrogels to progress cardiac disease models. 

Code is currently designed to work with OBI files that have channels ordered DAPI, Alpha-SMA, ACTIN. FIles are meant to be run in order manual_thres.py, which opens a napri window which is used to manually set the thresholds for much easier segmentation this will create a binary TIFF file of the masked regions. Next is cell matching.py which matches DAPI and actin objects together and discards the rest of the objects and thresholds the reamining objects based on the Otsu threshold of the actin boundary box, this produces a numpy array file (.npy) that has two 3D arrays for the masked DAPI and actin channel where each objects has is own unique integer that starts and 2 and goes up, matched DAPI and actin objects have the same integer indicated in each array. Final extract measurements, calculates specific parameters for each cell and writes them to an excel file.
